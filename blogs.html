                <p><br>With the dust settling on Apple’s first Arm-based Macs and new M1 chip announcements, it’s time to take stock of what this means for one of the industry’s biggest computing ecosystems. The transition to Arm CPUs is a major shift that will be felt across the industry in the coming years.

                    How often do you need to practice to master the skill of programming?
                    
                    What do you need to do to speed up the learning process?
                    
                    Are we alone in the universe?
                    
                    I am sure you have asked yourself all 4 of these questions at least once in your life.
                    
                    Today,
                    
                    you WILL NOT find out the solution, I can’t help you find these answers nor I can predict the future and know how much effort you will put on it,
                    
                    One thing I can do though is telling you about my journey on how I achieved my first 10000 hours..</p>
